## Web Based Selector - Applicant Simulation Software
### Problem Statement
  #### Background: 
  Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next    higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. 
  #### Description: 
  The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing   a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the        applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. 
  #### Expected Solution: 
  The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real    life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be   able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate         responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus     his/ her suitability against the advertised post.
### Proposed Solution
  - **AI-Driven Board Room Experience:**
    Uses AI to simulate a realistic interview environment, starting with ice-breaking questions
    and progressing to techno-managerial ones based on the candidate's level.
  - **Performance Scoring:**
    Provides a quantifiable score for both experts and candidates based on the relevancy of
    questions and answers.Evaluates expert questions and candidate responses for relevance to the role and expertise.
  - **Relevancy-focused Interview:**
    Prioritizes relevant questions and answers, with higher weight on relevancy over clarity.
    Candidates are not penalized for irrelevant questions asked by interviewers.
### How it Addresses the Problem:
  - **Structured Interview Flow:** AI ensures a smooth progression from ice-breaker to techno-
    managerial questions, adapting to the candidate's level and expertise.
  - **Relevancy-based Scoring:** By using AI to evaluate relevance, the system ensures that only
    meaningful questions and answers are scored, addressing the issue of irrelevant
    discussions.
  - **Objective Assessment:** The AI provides unbiased, quantifiable scores for both the
    candidate and interviewers, ensuring a fair evaluation of subject knowledge and suitability
    for the role.
  - **Feedback for Interviewers:** Experts also receive feedback on the relevance of their
    questions, helping improve the quality of interviews and ensuring alignment with the role  
    being hired for.
